"""Compose the ``so101_box`` MJCF.

Everything that controls scene geometry — box dimensions, robot base
pose, OAK-D Pro overhead camera placement, wrist camera placement,
slotted block + tube dimensions — is sourced from a single typed
``BoxSceneOptions`` dataclass.  The dataclass is filled from the
YAML's ``scene.backend_options`` block in :mod:`.env`, so any future
"SO-101 in a box" variant is a pure YAML edit.

The composer reads the upstream
``robot_descriptions:so_arm101_mj_description`` MJCF
(``TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100/Simulation/SO101/so101_new_calib.xml``),
re-anchors its ``<body name="base">`` to the configured robot pose,
splices a wrist camera into the ``<body name="gripper">`` body, and
appends the arena + camera + tube + slotted-block bodies to the
worldbody.  The result is written next to the upstream MJCF so
``meshdir="assets"`` resolves at compile time without copying any
mesh STLs.

    """Every dimension and pose the ``so101_box`` scene exposes.

    Lengths are metres, angles are radians unless suffixed ``_deg``.

    Attributes:
        box_size_xyz: Inside dimensions of the box arena in metres
            ``(X, Y, Z)``. Default ``(1.00, 0.615, 0.75)`` matches the
            user-specified scene (100 cm wide × 61.5 cm deep × 75 cm
            tall).
        wall_thickness: Half-thickness of the floor / wall geoms in
            metres. The walls extend OUTWARD from the inside surface,
            i.e. the inside dimension is ``box_size_xyz``.
        robot_base_xyz: World-frame position of the SO-101 ``base``
            body, in metres. Defaults to ``(0.50, 0.50, 0.0)`` —
            back-centre on the floor, leaving ~11 cm to the back wall.
        robot_base_yaw_deg: Rotation about world +Z applied to the
            SO-101 base body, in degrees. Default ``0.0`` keeps the
            arm pointing toward decreasing Y (i.e. toward the front of
            the box, away from the back wall the base sits against).
        wrist_camera_pos_local: Wrist-camera position in the SO-101
            ``gripper`` body frame, in metres. Default
            ``(0.03, -0.02, -0.06)`` sits the camera just above/behind
            the fingertips.
        wrist_camera_target_local: Wrist-camera look-at target in the
            same local frame. Default looks along the gripper APPROACH
            axis (gripper-local -X = world-down at the home pose, i.e.
            where the fingers point / what gets grasped), so the jaw and
            the object ahead stay in frame at every arm pose.
        wrist_camera_fovy: Vertical field of view of the wrist camera,
            degrees. Default ``75`` gives a wide wrist-cam view.
        oak_top_camera_pos: World-frame position of the overhead
            OAK-D Pro, in metres. Default
            ``(0.50, 0.3075, 0.75)`` — centred on the box, sitting on
            the ceiling.
        oak_top_camera_target: World-frame look-at target. Default
            looks straight down at the floor centre.
        oak_top_camera_fovy: Vertical field of view of the OAK-D Pro,
            degrees. Default ``54`` mirrors the real OAK-D Pro's
            RGB FoV when configured for 4:3 imaging.
        slot_block_size: Slotted block outside dimensions ``(X, Y, Z)``,
            in metres. Default ``(0.0445, 0.0445, 0.020)`` matches the
            sketch (44.5 × 44.5 × 20 mm).
        slot_block_hole_diameter: Diameter of the hole through the
            block, in metres. The hole is modelled as a square of the
            same edge length (so the cylindrical tube clears the
            walls; the corners contribute extra clearance that does
            not affect insertion success). Default ``0.023`` m.
        slot_block_slot_width: Width of the slot connecting the hole
            to one edge of the block, metres. Default ``0.005``.
        slot_block_mass: Mass of the slotted block, kg. Default
            ``0.05``.
        tube_radius: Tube radius in metres. Default ``0.01095`` (Ø 21.9 mm).
        tube_length: Tube length in metres. Default ``0.090`` (90 mm).
        tube_mass: Tube mass in kg. Default ``0.020``.
        block_spawn_xy_range: Block spawn area in world frame, given
            as ``((x_min, x_max), (y_min, y_max))``. Both block and
            tube spawn lying flat on the floor at random (x, y) and a
            random yaw within ``[-pi, pi]``. The block z is fixed at
            ``block_size_z / 2`` (resting on the floor).
        tube_spawn_xy_range: Tube spawn area in world frame; same
            shape as ``block_spawn_xy_range``. Tube spawns lying on
            its side (z = ``tube_radius``).
        spawn_min_separation: Minimum centre-to-centre separation
            between the block and the tube at spawn, metres. The
            spawn sampler retries the tube draw until this is met (up
            to 32 attempts).

    The output path is a sibling of the robot's upstream MJCF so its
    ``meshdir="assets"`` resolves at compile time without copying
    STL meshes.  The XML string is also returned for inspection /
    unit-tests that don't want to touch the filesystem.

    Args:
        options: Scene options. ``None`` falls back to all defaults
            (matches :class:`BoxSceneOptions` field defaults).
        robot_description: Robot whose ``assets.mjcf`` provides the base arm
            MJCF (ADR-0033). ``None`` falls back to the SO-101 MJCF, keeping the
            legacy call path byte-for-byte unchanged. The robot must share the
            so_arm splice anchors (a base body + a roll-mounted end body).
        base_body: Override for ``BoxSceneOptions.base_body`` (the re-anchored
            base body name — ``Base`` for SO-100). ``None`` keeps the default.
        gripper_body: Override for ``BoxSceneOptions.gripper_body`` (the
            wrist-camera parent body — ``Fixed_Jaw`` for SO-100). ``None`` keeps
            the default.
        wrist_camera_pos_local: Override for the wrist-camera position in the
            gripper-body frame. ``None`` keeps the default.
        wrist_camera_target_local: Override for the wrist-camera look-at target.
            ``None`` keeps the default.
        wrist_camera_fovy: Override for the wrist-camera vertical FoV (degrees).
            ``None`` keeps the default.

    The flat keyword overrides are YAML-friendly so the manifest-driven node can
    set the SO-100 splice anchors + wrist-camera pose via
    ``scene_defaults.composition.params`` without constructing a
    :class:`BoxSceneOptions` (issue #88).

    Returns:
        ``(xml, output_path)`` — ``xml`` is the composed MJCF; the
        same string is written to ``output_path`` next to the
        upstream MJCF.

    Raises:
        ROSConfigError: If any required upstream MJCF landmark
            (the base body, the gripper/end body, the closing
            ``</worldbody>``) is missing — those are the splice
            anchors and a future upstream rename would surface here
